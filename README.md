# ISR (iterative sequential regression)

This release contains the original code developed for the manuscript [manuscript by Schlackow et al on Surveillance of Infection Severity: A Registry Study of Laboratory Diagnosed Clostridium difficile](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001279).

Please note that the code is not being maintained.

In this fork we provide an R script that should be run, simplest using the R base function source() https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/source in order to update the code to work with current version of packages such as ggplot2.
